# Positioning Reticle

## Description
As a means of verifying the accuracy of the gaze positioning in relationship to the display, we have created a reticle device. The device is simple to construct and will not damage the display device.

The reticle is built using a cheap child's toy as a means of obtaining suction cups at a reasonable price.

## Parts
The reticle is constructed with two laser cut pieces of 2mm thick acrylic, plus a few other parts. In our experience, different toy dart guns had differing characteristics of the suction cup. This model worked well in our small set of samples, though many other models will likely work. If you choose a different toy dart gun be sure to adjust the size of the holes to fit your dart.

Note that just about any string will work. The critical characteristic is that the string is not particularly elastic.

## Assembly

The assembly is very straight forward. We removed the white shafts from the suction cups, pushed the suction cups through the three holes in the rear sight, then pushed the white shafts back to lock the suction cups into place. The standoffs were screwed into the rear sight, then the front sight was secured with the M3 screws. Finally, a lenght of string was tied through the hole on the front sight. Once attached to the monitor a mark was made on the string indicating 65cm from the display. The 65cm measurement is based on the common optimal distance for display mounted eye trackers.
